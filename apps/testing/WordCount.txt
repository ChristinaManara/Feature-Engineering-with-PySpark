At times, it becomes very handy to have a word counter tool which can give anyone an idea or an overview of the content he or she has written and how many words or even characters it already contains. Such needs may arise when a person works in the field of academics, who must write research papers, articles, journals or assignments, as a student. Normally a writer is limited by a word count by the target instance rules or acceptance guidance of some magazine or internet blog.
So, what do you do if you have bumped into the requirements to limit the amount of the text inside your article and you must follow the strict rules prompted by your customer? How can you get the information on how many paragraphs or words have you already typed and what is the common character count of the already prepared article on the competitor’s web blog?
